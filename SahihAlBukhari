Due to the non-existence of appropriate and equivalent English \nwords for many Arabic words, such words have been \ntransliterated and an explanation has been given immediately \nafter each word when it occurs for the first time and a glossary \nof such words has been compiled at the end of this book. \nCertain religious formulas and invocations are also \ntransliterated. \n2. The Arabic script is kept as it is for such expressions as jt \n(The Most High), \t\ni \t\n(peace be upon him), and \n(Allah be pleased with him) etc. \n3. Some materials concerned with Arabic grammar and etymology \nhave been excluded from the English text. \n4. Most of the subnarrators are often omitted when possible and \nsometimes oniy the first narrator in each string is kept. \nlmâm BukhârI in his SahIh has classified and arranged the \n:jiidjth according to the subject matter which they deal with. \nHe gave to each chapter a title indicating a certain point and \nrdec that title he stated down all the Ahâdith that are relevant. \nhis procedure has resulted in the occurrence of the same \nJith under various headings, because one HadIth might deal \ne a great number of aspects of Islamic Jurisprudence.

The authenticity of Al-BukhârI's work is such that the \nreligious learned scholars of Islam said concerning him: \"The most \nauthentic book after the Book of Allah (i.e. Al-Qur'ân) is SahIh \nAl-BukhârI.\" \nImâm BukhârI was born on 13th Shawwâl in the year 194 A.H. \nin Bukhârâ in the territory of Khurâsân (West Turkistân). His real \nname is Muhammad bin Ismâil bin Al-MughIrah Al-BukhârI. \nHis father died when he was still a young child and he was \nlooked after by his mother. At the age of ten he started acquiring \nthe knowledge of HadIth. He travelled to Makkah when he was \nsixteen years old accompanied by his mother and elder brother. It \nseemed as though Imâm BukhârI loved Makkah and its learned \nreligious scholars for he remained in Makkah after bidding farewell \nto his mother and brother. He spent two years in Makkah and then \nwent to Al-MadIna. After spending a total of six years in Al-Hijâz \nwhich comprises Makkah and Al-MadIna, he left for Basrah, Küfa \nand Baghdad and visited many other places including Egypt and \nSyria. He came to Baghdad on many occasions. He met many \nreligious learned scholars including Imâm Ahmad bin Hanbal. \nOwing to his honesty and kindness and the fact that he was \ntrustworthy he used to keep away from the princes and rulers for \nfear that he may incline to say things to please them. \nMany a story has been told about Imâm BukhârI regarding his \nstruggles in collecting HadIth literature. He travelled to many \ndifferent places gathering the precious gems that fell from the lips \nof the noble Prophet Muhammad \t\n4i \t . It is said that Imâm \nBukhârI collected over 300,000 AhadIth and he himself memorized \n200,000 of which some were unreliable. He was born at a time \n"

Imâm BukhârI asked some of those who \ninterpret dreams, and they interpreted his dream that he will drive \naway the falsehood asserted against the Prophet _.j \nSo it was a great task for him to sift the forged AhadIth from the \nauthentic ones. He laboured day and night and although he had \nmemorised such a large number he only chose approximately 7,275 \nwith repetition and about 2,230 without repetition of which there is \nno doubt about their authenticity. \nBefore he recorded each HadIth, he would make ablution and \noffer a two Rak'az' prayer and supplicate his Lord (Allah). Many \nreligious scholars of Islam tried to find fault in the great remarkable \ncollection - SahIh Al-BukhârI, but without success. It is for this \nreason, they unanimously agreed that the most authentic book after \nthe Book of Allah is SahIh Al-BukhârI. \nImâm BukhârI died on first Shawwâl in the year 256 A.H., and \nwas buried in Khartank, a village near Samarkand.
